# Computer Communications and Networks


## Project 1

First project focussed on communication using TCP and UDP protocols. The task was to create a client to a remote server that is able to use TCP or UDP protocol.


## Project 2

In this task I choose variant of the project where I tried to create my own L4 port scanner. (something simular like [NMAP](https://nmap.org) tool).
