# The C Programing language

## Description

### Project 1

The main part of this project was to use a bit field to find the last 10 prime numbers smaller than 300 000 000. 
Eratosten sieve is used as an algorithm for finding prime numbers. The second part of the task was focused on working with an image in .ppm format 
from which we had to extract a steganographically encoded message. The message was hidden on the last bit of pixels located at prime number indexes.

Part of the project was also to implement macros and inline functions over the bit array and compare the running time of the program with macros and inline functions.

### Project 2

The first part of this project was focused on creating a function similar to the tail command from the unix shell using a cyclic buffer.

The second part of this project was focused on creating a hash table and a program that will count the individual occurrence of words in the text.
