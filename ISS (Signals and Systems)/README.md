# Signals and Systems

## Project

This project focuses on the analysis of the sound signal of a piano. It is divided into 4 parts:

1. Loading piano tones from ```piano.wav```. Spectral analysis of three selected signals and display of three periods of each signal.
2. Finding the frequency of the given tones using discrete Fourier transformation and Autocorrelation. And the subsequent comparison of these two methods.
3. Refinement of obtained frequencies using DTFT (Discrete-time Fourier transformation).
4. Representation of each tone using ten values, i.e. five pairs of modulus and phase in multiples of the frequency of individual tones.
