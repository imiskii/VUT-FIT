# Algorithms

## Description

The projects of this subject were focused on abstract data types. The task was to create functions over these abstract data types.

* __Binary Tree__ - there are 2 versions. First with recursive implementation and second with iterative implementation
* __Doubly Linked List__
* __Hash Table__ - hash table implemented with static array
* __Queue__
* __Singly Linked List__
* __Stack__ - stack was not part of this project but I use it for different project, just put it here because it fits there. It is simple stack storing void pointer data type.
