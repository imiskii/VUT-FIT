# CCNA Cybersecurity Operations

This project was intended as a CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge. We were given a virtual machine (VM) and the goal was to obtain root privileges by exposing various vulnerabilities and documenting the entire process.

The VM was configured to use NAT networking with TCP ports 22/2222, 8000/8000 and 8443/8443 forwarded. We had to look for running services on these ports.
