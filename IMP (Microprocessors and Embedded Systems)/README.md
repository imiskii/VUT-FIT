## Project - Bluetooth Metronome

The project's objective was to develop an embedded application on the ESP32 platform, serving as a metronome controllable through WebBluetooth. The metronome incorporates essential features, including speed, rhythm, and volume adjustments. The development utilized the esp-idf framework, while the web Bluetooth client was created in JavaScript, with a simple interface in HTML and CSS. Additional details about the functionality can be found in the [documentation](BluetoothMetronom/doc/documentation.pdf).
