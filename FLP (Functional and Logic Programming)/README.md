# Functional and Logic Programming

## Haskell

This project was focused on implementing and working with decision trees using the Haskell programming language. It was divided into two main tasks:

1. **Classification Using a Given Decision Tree**: Task was to define internal data types to represent a decision tree, load this tree from a structured text file, and then classify new input data based on the tree.

2. **Training a Decision Tree from Data**: The second task involved implementing a simplified version of a training algorithm inspired by CART (Classification and Regression Trees). The program read training data and construct a decision tree capable of classifying new data.

## Prolog

This project involved implementing a solver for the Rubik's Cube puzzle in Prolog. The main objective was to develop a program capable of transforming a scrambled cube into its solved state, where each face is uniformly colored. The input to the program was a textual representation of the cube's scrambled state, and the output was a step-by-step solution showing the cubeâ€™s configuration after each move. The solver utilized a sequence of legal cube rotations and aimed to produce a solution path.
