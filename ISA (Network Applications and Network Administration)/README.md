## Project dhcp-stats

The project aimed to create a tool that monitors assigned IPv4 addresses. If allocations surpass 50%, the tool generates a syslog record. The monitoring is based on analyzing captured DHCP packets or a `.pcap` file with DHCP communication. Further details about the tool's options and functions are available in the [documentation/manual](dhcp-stats-project/doc/manual.pdf).
