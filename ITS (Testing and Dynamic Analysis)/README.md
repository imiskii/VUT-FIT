## Project

The task was to design and implement tests for [Open Cart](https://www.opencart.com) web page. 

The project consists of 2 parts, in the first part, I designed a set of tests using Gherkin Syntax.
The second part was focused on the implementation of the designed tests using python, selenium and behave.
