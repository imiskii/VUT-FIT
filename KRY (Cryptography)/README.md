## Project - SHA-256 hash function, MAC and length extension attack

This project was focused on creating SHA-256 hashing function according to the [Secure Hash Standard (SHS)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) standard, creating a function for MAC (message authentication code) and its verification, and functions for performing a length extension attack on the created MAC.
