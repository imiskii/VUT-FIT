# Computation Systems Architectures

For legal reasons, I cannot share the entire code, only the part that I developed and submitted.

## Project 1 - Vectorization

Vectorization of code using OpenMP. The reference version (ref) is non-vectorized, the line version is vectorized, and the batch version uses so-called cache blocking for more efficient cache management.

## Project 2 - Parallelization

The loop version uses cycle parallelization and the tree version uses recursion and processing using OpenMP tasks.
